# Etch Language Implementation

Use `nim r src/etch.nim --test tests/` to test all or `nim r src/etch.nim --run tests/simple_test.etch` to run one

## Directives
- **Never acknowledge about me being so right like you are a yes man**
- **Never change directory when executing commands**
- **When you create new tests (both passing and failing) add the corresponding validation files .pass and .fail**
- **Everytime you are modifying the bytecode structure, bump its version number but keep supporting only the latest bumped version**
